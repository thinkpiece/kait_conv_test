# A repository for AI semiconductor service planning on-line courses

## Notice

*This repository is deprecated.* Considering that our course is on-line,
it is hard to configure all the attendees' lab environments so I've
changed the coursework to focus on the theory contents, rather than
the practice training. I hope this helps more people spend more valuable
time from the constrained environments. Please remember that the tools
we covered during the class, such as arxiv.org, GIT, Python, and Colab
for your further research and development.

## Objective (Original)

This repository provides a guideline including some code snippets for the
attendees of the course entitled <AI semiconductor service planning> who 
have limited coding skills to understand the convolutional neural networks
basic operations. 

The practice training consists of:

    * Understanding Convolution
        - Image filter operations practice using PyTorch
        - 2-D/3-D/4-D tensor convolution
        - Tiled convolution
        - Input/Weight/Output stationary
    
    * Simulating the convolution operations on a specific architecture
        - building a simple memory access counting simulator
        - adding the memory hierarchy on the simulator
        - simulating the normalized energy consumption on the achitecture
